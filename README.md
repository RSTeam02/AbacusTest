#AbacusTest

This app is inspired by the abacus calculator, but there are no (mechanical) shifts, only indicators (colors), 
if certain dots are clicked (on or off), therefore the digits of factor 10 will be incremented or decremented.
Each digit is structured by 1x 5 (top) and 4x 1 dots (the rest). The digit-value can be set in a range from 0 to 9.
It uses the SVG layout from the previous project, by rotating the raster by 90 degrees the dots will be assigned to the right digit.
